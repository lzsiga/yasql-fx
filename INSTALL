YASQL

Requirements:

   Perl 5
       This was developed with Perl 5.6, but is known to work
       on 5.005_03 and above.  Any earlier version of Perl 5
       may or may not work.  Perl 4 will definately not work.

   Unix environment
       YASQL was developed under GNU/Linux, and aimed at as many
       Unix installations as possible.  Known to be
       compatible with GNU/Linux, AIX and Sun Solaris.
       Please send me an email (qzy@users.sourceforge.net) if it
       works for other platforms.  I'd be especially
       interested if it worked on Win32.

   Oracle Server
       It has been tested and developed for Oracle8 and
       Oracle8i.  There is atleast one issue with Oracle7
       that I know of (see ISSUES below) and I have not
       tested it with Oracle9 yet.

   Oracle client libraries
       The Oracle client libraries must be installed for
       DBD::Oracle.  Of course you can't install DBD::Oracle
       without them...

   DBD::Oracle
       DBD::Oracle must be installed since this uses DBI for
       database connections.

   ORACLE_HOME
       The ORACLE_HOME environment variable must be set if
       you use a connection descriptor to connect so that
       YASQL can translate the descriptor into usefull
       connection information to make the actual connection.

   ORACLE_SID
       The ORACLE_SID environment variable must be set unless
       you specify one with the -s option (see options
       above).

   Term::Readline
       Term::Readline must be installed (it is with most Perl
       installations), but more importantly, installing
       Term::ReadLine::Gnu from CPAN will greatly enhance the
       usability.

   Time::HiRes
       This is used for high resolution benchmarking.  It is
       optional.

   Text::CSV_XS
       This perl module is required if you want to output CSV
       or input from CSV files.  If you don't plan on using
       this features, then you don't need to install this
       module.

   Term::ReadKey
       This module is used for better input and output
       control.  Right now it isn't required, but some parts
       of YASQL will look and function better with this
       installed.

Installation:

 * ./configure

   The following options to configure are used by YASQL:
     --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
                             [/usr/local]
     --exec-prefix=EPREFIX   install architecture-dependent files in EPREFIX
                             [same as prefix]
     --bindir=DIR            user executables in DIR [EPREFIX/bin]
     --sysconfdir=DIR        read-only single-machine data in DIR [PREFIX/etc]
     --mandir=DIR            man documentation in DIR [PREFIX/man]

     
 
 * make
 
 * make install

Etc:

type 'man yasql' for usage instructions.

type 'yasql' to run it!

To report success, run (replace First M. Last with your name):
 ( echo 'First M. Last'; grep "# .Id" `which yasql`; perl -V ) | \
 mail -s "YASQL install success" qzy@users.sourceforge.net

To use the advanced features you should have the Term::Readline:Gnu perl 
package installed, as well as the Time::HiRes module.  Both of these are 
optional, but they really are nice to have.

Please report any problems to qzy@users.sourceforge.net.
