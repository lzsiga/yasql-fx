.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\s-1YASQL\s0 is an open source Oracle command line interface.  \s-1YASQL\s0 features a much
kinder alternative to SQL*Plus's user interface.  This is meant to be a
complete replacement for SQL*Plus when dealing with ad hoc queries and general
database interfacing.  It's main features are:
.IP "Full ReadLine support" 4
.IX Item "Full ReadLine support"
Allows the same command line style editing as other ReadLine enabled programs
such as \s-1BASH\s0 and the Perl Debugger.  You can edit the command line as well as
browse your command history.  The command 
history is saved in your home directory in a file called .yasql_history.  You 
can also use tab completion on all table and column names.
.IP "Alternate output methods" 4
.IX Item "Alternate output methods"
A different style of output suited to each type of need.  There are currently
table, list and \s-1CSV\s0 output styles.  Table style outputs in the same manner as 
SQL*Plus, except the column widths are set based on the width of the data in 
the column, and not the column length defined in the table schema.  List outputs
each row on it's own line, column after column for easier viewing of wide return
results.  \s-1CSV\s0 outputs the data in Comma Seperated Values format, for easy
import into many other database/spreadsheet programs.
.IP "Output of query results" 4
.IX Item "Output of query results"
You can easily redirect the output of any query to an external file
.IP "Data Input and Binding" 4
.IX Item "Data Input and Binding"
\&\s-1YASQL\s0 allows you to bind data in an external \s-1CSV\s0 file to any query, using
standard \s-1DBI\s0 placeholders.  This is the ultimate flexibility when inserting or
updating data in the database.
.IP "Command pipes" 4
.IX Item "Command pipes"
You can easily pipe the output of any query to an external program.
.IP "Tab completion" 4
.IX Item "Tab completion"
All tables, columns, and other misc objects can be completed using tab, much
like you can with bash.
.IP "Easy top rownum listings" 4
.IX Item "Easy top rownum listings"
You can easily put a number after a terminator, which will only output those
number of lines.  No more typing \*(L"where rownum < 10\*(R" after every query.  Now
you can type 'select * from table;10' instead.
.IP "Enhanced Data Dictionary commands" 4
.IX Item "Enhanced Data Dictionary commands"
Special commands like 'show tables', 'desc <table>', 'show indexes on <table>',
\&'desc <sequence>', and many many more so that you can easily see your schema.
.IP "Query editing" 4
.IX Item "Query editing"
You can open and edit queries in your favorite text editor.
.IP "Query chaining" 4
.IX Item "Query chaining"
You can put an abitrary number of queries on the same line, and each will be
executed in turn.
.IP "Basic scripting" 4
.IX Item "Basic scripting"
You can put basic \s-1SQL\s0 queries in a script and execute them from \s-1YASQL\s0.
.IP "Config file" 4
.IX Item "Config file"
You can create a config file of options so that you don't have to set them
everytime you run it.
.IP "Future extensibility" 4
.IX Item "Future extensibility"
We, the community, can modify and add to this whatever we want, we can't do that
with SQL*Plus.
.SH "REQUIREMENTS"
.IX Header "REQUIREMENTS"
.IP "Perl 5" 4
.IX Item "Perl 5"
This was developed with Perl 5.6, but is known to work on 5.005_03 and above.
Any earlier version of Perl 5 may or may not work.  Perl 4 will definately not
work.
.IP "Unix environment" 4
.IX Item "Unix environment"
\&\s-1YASQL\s0 was developed under GNU/Linux, and aimed at as many Unix installations as 
possible.  Known to be compatible with GNU/Linux, \s-1AIX\s0 and Sun Solaris.
Please send me an email (qzy@users.sourceforge.net) if it works for other platforms.
I'd be especially interested if it worked on Win32.
.IP "Oracle Server" 4
.IX Item "Oracle Server"
It has been tested and developed for Oracle8 and Oracle8i.  There is atleast
one issue with Oracle7 that I know of (see \s-1ISSUES\s0 below) and I have not tested
it with Oracle9i yet.
.IP "Oracle client libraries" 4
.IX Item "Oracle client libraries"
The Oracle client libraries must be installed for DBD::Oracle.  Of course you
can't install DBD::Oracle without them...
.IP "DBD::Oracle" 4
.IX Item "DBD::Oracle"
DBD::Oracle must be installed since this uses \s-1DBI\s0 for database connections.
.IP "\s-1ORACLE_HOME\s0" 4
.IX Item "ORACLE_HOME"
The \s-1ORACLE_HOME\s0 environment variable must be set if you use a connection 
descriptor to connect so that \s-1YASQL\s0 can translate the descriptor into 
usefull connection information to make the actual connection.
.IP "\s-1ORACLE_SID\s0" 4
.IX Item "ORACLE_SID"
The \s-1ORACLE_SID\s0 environment variable must be set unless you specify one with the 
\&\-s option (see options above).
.IP "Term::Readline" 4
.IX Item "Term::Readline"
Term::Readline must be installed (it is with most Perl installations), but more 
importantly, installing Term::ReadLine::Gnu from \s-1CPAN\s0 will greatly enhance the 
usability.
.IP "Time::HiRes" 4
.IX Item "Time::HiRes"
This is used for high resolution benchmarking.  It is optional.
.IP "Text::CSV_XS" 4
.IX Item "Text::CSV_XS"
This perl module is required if you want to output \s-1CSV\s0 or input from \s-1CSV\s0 files.
If you don't plan on using this features, then you don't need to install this
module.
.IP "Term::ReadKey" 4
.IX Item "Term::ReadKey"
This module is used for better input and output control.  Right now it isn't
required, but some parts of \s-1YASQL\s0 will look and function better with this
installed.
.SH "CONFIG"
.IX Header "CONFIG"
\&\s-1YASQL\s0 will look for a config file first in ~/.yasqlrc then 
/etc/yasql.conf.  The following options are available:
.IP "connection_timeout = <seconds>" 4
.IX Item "connection_timeout = <seconds>"
Timeout for connection attempts
.Sp
Default: 20
.IP "max_connection_attempts = <num>" 4
.IX Item "max_connection_attempts = <num>"
The amount of times to attempt the connection if the username/password are wrong
.Sp
Default: 3
.IP "history_file = <file>" 4
.IX Item "history_file = <file>"
Where to save the history file.  Shell metachars will be globbed (expanded)
.Sp
Default: ~/.yasql_history
.IP "pager = <file>" 4
.IX Item "pager = <file>"
Your favorite pager for extended output. (right now only the help command)
.Sp
Default: /bin/more
.IP "auto_commit = [0/1]" 4
.IX Item "auto_commit = [0/1]"
Autocommit any updates/inserts etc
.Sp
Default: 0
.IP "commit_on_exit = [0/1]" 4
.IX Item "commit_on_exit = [0/1]"
Commit any pending transactions on exit.  Errors or crashes will still cause
the current transaction to rollback.  But with this on a commit will occur
when you explicitly exit.
.Sp
Default: 0
.IP "long_trunc_ok = [0/1]" 4
.IX Item "long_trunc_ok = [0/1]"
Long truncation \s-1OK\s0.  If set to 1 then when a row contains a field that is
set to a \s-1LONG\s0 time, such as \s-1BLOB\s0, \s-1CLOB\s0, etc will be truncated to long_read_len
length.  If 0, then the row will be skipped and not outputted.
.Sp
Default: 1
.IP "long_read_len = <num_chars>" 4
.IX Item "long_read_len = <num_chars>"
Long Read Length.  This is the length of characters to truncate to if 
long_trunc_ok is on
.Sp
Default: 80
.IP "edit_history = [0/1]" 4
.IX Item "edit_history = [0/1]"
Whether or not to put the query edited from the 'edit' command into the
command history.
.Sp
Default: 1
.IP "auto_complete = [0/1]" 4
.IX Item "auto_complete = [0/1]"
Whether or not to generate the autocompletion list on connection.  If connecting
to a large database (in number of tables/columns sense), the generation process
could take a bit. For most databases it shouldn't take long at all though.
.Sp
Default: 1
.IP "extended_complete_list = [0/1]" 4
.IX Item "extended_complete_list = [0/1]"
extended complete list will cause the possible matches list to be filled by
basicly any and all objects.  With it off the tab list will be restricted to
only tables, columns, and objects owned by the current user.
.Sp
Default: 0
.IP "complete_tables = [0/1]" 4
.IX Item "complete_tables = [0/1]"
This controls whether or not to add tables to the completion list.  This does
nothing if auto_complete is set to 0.
.Sp
Default: 1
.IP "complete_columns = [0/1]" 4
.IX Item "complete_columns = [0/1]"
This controls whether or not to add columns to the completion list.  This does
nothing if auto_complete is set to 0.
.Sp
Default: 1
.IP "complete_objects = [0/1]" 4
.IX Item "complete_objects = [0/1]"
This controls whether or not to add all other objects to the completion list.
This does nothing if auto_complete is set to 0. (Hint... depending on your
schema this will include tables and columns also, so you could turn the other
two off)
.Sp
Default: 1
.IP "extended_benchmarks = [0/1]" 4
.IX Item "extended_benchmarks = [0/1]"
Whether or not to include extended benchmarking info after queries.  Will 
include both execution times and \s-1CPU\s0 loads for both the query and formatting
parts of the process.
.Sp
Default: 0
.IP "prompt" 4
.IX Item "prompt"
A string to include in the prompt.  The prompt will always be suffixed by a
\&'>' string.  Interpolated variables:
 \f(CW%H\fR = connected host.  will be prefixed with a '@'
 \f(CW%U\fR = current user
.Sp
Default: \f(CW%U\fR%H
.IP "column_wildcards = [0/1]" 4
.IX Item "column_wildcards = [0/1]"
Column wildcards is an extremely experimental feature that is still being
hashed out due to the complex nature of it.  This should affect only select
statements and expands any wildcards (*) in the column list.  such as
\&'select col* from table;'.
.Sp
Default: 0
.IP "sql_query_in_error = [0/1]" 4
.IX Item "sql_query_in_error = [0/1]"
This this on to output the query in the error message.
.Sp
Default: 0
.IP "nls_date_format = <string>" 4
.IX Item "nls_date_format = <string>"
Set the preferred \s-1NLS_DATE_FORMAT\s0.  This effects both date input and output
formats.  The default is \s-1ISO\s0 standard (\s-1YYYY\-MM\-DD\s0 \s-1HH24:MI:SS\s0', not oracle
default (\s-1YYYY\-MM\-DD\s0).
.Sp
Default: YYYY-MM-DD \s-1HH24:MI:SS\s0
.IP "fast_describe" 4
.IX Item "fast_describe"
Turn on fast describes.  These are much faster than the old style of desc
<table>, however non-built in datatypes may not be returned properly.  i.e. a
\&\s-1FLOAT\s0 will be returned as a \s-1NUMBER\s0 type.  Internally FLOATs really are just
NUMBERs, but this might present problems for you.  If so, set this to 0
.Sp
Default: 1
.SH "ISSUES"
.IX Header "ISSUES"
.IP "Oracle7" 4
.IX Item "Oracle7"
DBD::Oracle for Oracle8 may have issues connecting to an Oracle7 database.  The
one problem I have seen is that the use of placeholders in a query will cause
oracle to issue an error \*(L"\s-1ORA\-01008:\s0 not all variables bound\*(R".  This will affect
all of the hard-coded queries that I use such as the ones for the 'desc' and
\&'show' commands.  The queries that you type in on the command line may still
work.  The DBD::Oracle \s-1README\s0 mentions the use of the '\-8' option to the
\&'perl Makefile.PL' command to use the older Oracle7 \s-1OCI\s0.  This has not been
tested.

Optimized describes to be as fast as describes in SQL*Plus.
Added new option 'fast_describe' on by default for new describe method.
Added single_output as a formatting option for internal use.

Re-worked debug output levels.
Optimized query for completion lists a bit.
Added completion-list limiting based on location in some \s-1DML\s0 statements (select, update, insert).

Fixed permissions in tarball
.PP
Revision 1.80  2001/08/01 18:06:27  nshafer
Fixed bug with delayed \f(CW$term\fR initialization
.PP
Revision 1.79  2001/08/01 17:52:35  nshafer
Fixed compatibility issues with the data dictionary in Oracle 7.  Fixed ordering
of indexes for compound indexes.  Fixed display of objects from other schemas
in some data dictionary commands such as 'show indexes on table'.  (Thanks Nix)
Fixed matching of declare and end in query string.  Will not only match if on
blank line.  Fixed matching of '/' terminator in middle of queries.  Will now
only match if at end of line (Thanks Wesley Hertlein).  Temp file for editing
now appends '.sql' to end of temp file so that editors, like vim, automatically
turn on syntax highlighting.  Added searching of environment variable \s-1SQLPATH\s0
when looking for scripts.  Terminal setup is now after script parsing, so that
it will work when run under cron (Thanks David Zverina).
.PP
Revision 1.78  2001/07/05 13:52:56  nshafer
Fixed bug where parens were matching improperly.
.PP
Revision 1.77  2001/07/04 02:57:08  nshafer
Fixed bug where terminators wouldn't match if they were the next character
after a quote character.
.PP
Revision 1.76  2001/06/28 04:17:53  nshafer
Term::ReadLine::Perl now supported, for what little functionality it does
provide.  Fixed segfault when hitting up when history is empty.  Fixed bug
when providing script names on command line (Thanks to Dave Zverina.)
Rewrote the query parser to fix a bug, caused by the multiple\-queries\-on\-one\-
line feature, that causes terminators, such as ';' and '/' to match when in
quotes.  When hitting tab on a line starting with a '@' for scripts, tab will
now complete filenames and not database objects.  Fixed \s-1DB\s0 timeout when
prompting for username and password.  Added support for '\s-1DECLARE\s0' keyword,
however this does not mean that variable binding in \s-1PL/SQL\s0 blocks works yet.
Sped up startup time a bit more (hopefully).
.PP
Revision 1.75  2001/06/19 16:02:16  nshafer
Fixed typo in error message for Term::ReadLine::Gnu
Fixed crash when tab hit at username or password prompt
Added \*(-- as a comment type and fixed case where comment in quotes would
match. (Mark Dalphin)
Fixed 'desc' to also describe partitioned tables (Erik)
.PP
Revision 1.74  2001/06/18 21:07:55  nshafer
Fixed bug where / would not rerun last query (thanks Scott Kister)
.PP
Revision 1.73  2001/05/23 18:35:17  nshafer
Got rid of \*(L"Prototype mismatch\*(R" errors.  Fixed typo in extended benchmarks
.PP
Revision 1.72  2001/05/22 16:06:36  nshafer
Fixed bug with error messages not displaying first time, and fixed bug with
tab completion output
.PP
Revision 1.71  2001/05/17 21:28:40  nshafer
New \s-1CSV\s0 output format.  Added \s-1CSV\s0 file input on any query.  Added ability to
pipe query results to any program.  Added ability for multiple queries on one
line.  Changed tab completion generator to run first time you hit tab instead
of on startup, which speeds up database connection.  Now using SelfLoader to
speed up loading and minimize memory use.  Added a 'show plan for _\|__\|_' command
for easy display of explain plan output.  Query times are now more readable
and will split into weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds.  Hopefully fixed
some problems with stty and Solaris 2.4.  Added support for 'rem' comments in
scripts.  Redirection output files are now shell expanded.
.PP
Revision 1.70  2001/05/08 17:49:51  nshafer
Fixed all places where a non-alphanumeric object name would break or not
match.
Added code for autoconf style installs.
.PP
Revision 1.69  2001/05/07 23:47:47  nshafer
fixed type
.PP
Revision 1.68  2001/05/07 22:26:20  nshafer
Fixed tab completion problems when completing objects with a $ in their name.
Added config options complete_tables, complete_columns, and complete_objects,
Added redirection of query output to file.  Hopefully sped up exiting.
Updated documentation.
.PP
Revision 1.67  2001/05/04 17:35:04  nshafer
\&\s-1YASQL\s0 will now suspend properly back to the shell when \s-1SIGTSTP\s0 is sent, as in
when you hit ctrl-z on most systems.  Added \s-1NLS_DATE_FORMAT\s0 setting in config
file to support alter date views.  Defaults to \s-1ISO\s0 standard.  \s-1YASQL\s0 will now
attempt to change it's process name, such as when viewed in ps or top.  This
will not work on all systems, nor is it a complete bullet proof way to hide
your password if you provide it on the command line.  But it helps to not
make it so obvious to regular users.  Scripts entered on the command line are
now checked to be readable before attempting connection.  A failed 'connect
command will no long alter the prompt.  Added \ep option for printing the
current buffer, ala psql.  Large query results (over 1000 rows) are now
handled \s-1MUCH\s0 better.  \s-1YASQL\s0 will no longer try to hold more than 1000 rows in
memory, which keeps it from sucking memory, and also improves the speed.
When a query does return more than 1000 rows in table mode, those first 1000
will determine the column widths, and all rows after that will get truncated.
\&\s-1AIX\s0 has been reported to run \s-1YASQL\s0 perfectly.
.PP
Revision 1.66  2001/03/13 21:34:58  nshafer
There are no longer any references to termcap, so yasql should now work on
termcap-less systems such as Debian Linux and \s-1AIX\s0
.PP
Revision 1.65  2001/03/12 17:44:31  nshafer
Restoring the terminal is hopefully more robust and better now.  \s-1YASQL\s0 now
tries to use the 'stty' program to dump the settings of the terminal on
startup so that it can restore it back to those settings.  It requires that
stty is installed in the path, but that should be the case with most systems.
Also made the output of the query in the error message an option that is off
by default.  I had never meant to include that in the final release, but kept
on forgetting to take it out.
.PP
Revision 1.64  2001/03/06 16:00:33  nshafer
Fixed bug where desc would match anytime, even in middle of query, which is
bad.
.PP
Revision 1.63  2001/03/01 17:30:26  nshafer
Refined the ctrl-c process for not-so-linuxy \s-1OS\s0's, namely solaris.  Now
stripping out Dos carriage returns since SQL*Plus seems to.
.PP
Revision 1.62  2001/02/26 22:39:12  nshafer
Fixed bug where prompt would reset itself when a blank line was entered.
Added script argument on command line (Lance Klein)
Added support for any command line commands in the script (Lance Klein)
The 'desc' and 'show' commands no longer require a terminator (like ;) as long as the whole statement is on one line (Lance Klein)
Added option 'extended_tab_list' for a much bigger, more complete tab listing (Lance Klein)
The edit command is no longer limited to 1 query at a time.  You can now put any valid command or query, and as many of them as you want.  The parsing rules for the edit command is exactly identical to the script parsing.
cleaned up documentation a bit
.PP
Revision 1.61  2001/01/31 19:56:22  nshafer
changed CommitOnExit to be 1 by default, to emulate SQL*Plus behavior, and
at popular request

.PP
Revision 1.58  2001/01/24 15:27:00  nshafer
cleanup_after_signals is not in the Term::ReadLine::Stub, so it would
output error messages on systems without Term::ReadLine::Gnu.  Fixed
.PP
Revision 1.57  2001/01/17 23:26:53  nshafer
Added Tom Renfro's column_wildcard expansion code.  New conf variable:
column_wildcards.  0 by default until this code is expanded on a bit more.
.PP
Revision 1.56  2001/01/17 23:00:25  nshafer
Added CommitOnExit config, 0 by default.  Added info output at startup and
when a new connection is initiated about the state of AutoCommit and
CommitOnExit.  Also added statement about explicit rollback or commit when
disconnecting.  Added warning message to commit_cmd and rollback_cmd if
AutoCommit is on.  Now explicitly committing or rolling back on disconnect,
it is no longer left up to the \s-1DBI\s0's discretion... except in abnormal
termination.
.PP
Revision 1.55  2001/01/11 18:05:12  nshafer
 Added trap for regex errors in tab completion (like if you put 'blah[' then
hit tab)
.PP
Revision 1.54  2001/01/10 17:07:22  nshafer
added output to those last 2 commands
.PP
Revision 1.53  2001/01/10 17:03:58  nshafer
added commit and rollback commands so that you don't have to send them to the
backend

updated todo list
.PP
Revision 1.45  2001/01/09 18:32:35  nshafer
Added 'connect <connect_string>' command.  I may add the ability to specify
options like on the command line (like '\-H blah.com')
.PP
Revision 1.44  2001/01/08 22:08:49  nshafer

benchmark info
.PP
Revision 1.38  2001/01/05 16:39:47  nshafer
Fixed error where calling edit a second time would not open the file properly
because of the way \fIglob()\fR works.
.PP
Revision 1.37  2001/01/04 23:52:30  nshafer
changed the version string to parse it out of the revision string (duh...)
moved the prompting of username and password so that the check for the
oracle_home variable happens before.  Before if you didn't have the environment
variable set then it will prompt you for username and password, then die
with the error, which is annoying
fixed the quit calls so taht they properly erase the quit line from the
history.  I had broken this a long time ago when I added the exit status
param to the quit function
Outputting in full table format (';' terminator) with a num_rows number
(like ';100') would still cause the entire result set to be pulled into
memory, which was really slow and could take a lot of memory if the table
was large.  Fixed it so that it only pulls in num_rows number of rows when
using the digit option
.PP
Revision 1.36  2000/12/22 22:12:18  nshafer
fixed a wrong-quote-type in the debug messages

.PP
Revision 1.34  2000/12/22 21:57:01  nshafer
Added config file support, queries from the 'edit' command are now entered
into the command history (configurable), cleaned up the \s-1SIGINT\s0 actions quite
a bit so they should work better now, added LongReadLen and LongTruncOk
options so that \s-1LONG\s0 columns types won't mess up, added the number after terminator
feature to limit how many rows are returned.
.PP

.PP
Revision 1.30  2000/12/20 17:04:18  nshafer
Refined the shadow_redisplay stuff.  Now I will only use my builtin function
if the terminal type is set to \*(L"xterm\*(R" because that terminal type has a
broken termcap entry.  Also set it to not echo when entering password if
Term::ReadLine::Gnu is not installed
.PP
Revision 1.29  2000/12/20 15:47:56  nshafer
